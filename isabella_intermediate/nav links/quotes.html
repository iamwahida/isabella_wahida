        <h1>Some Quotes</h1>

<pre>When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, 'no, I went to films.
    -- Quentin Tarantino
</pre>
<pre>When I make a film, I am hoping to reinvent the genre a little bit. 
I just do it my way. I make my own little Quentin versions of them... 
I consider myself a student of cinema. 
It's almost like I am going for my professorship in cinema, 
and the day I die is the day I graduate. It is a lifelong study.
    -- Quentin Tarantino
</pre>
<pre>If you just love movies enough, you can make a good one.
    -- Quentin Tarantino
</pre>
<pre>Movies are my religion and God is my patron. 
I'm lucky enough to be in the position where I don't make movies to pay for my pool. 
When I make a movie, I want it to be everything to me; like I would die for it.
    -- Quentin Tarantino
</pre>
<pre>I don't believe you should stay onstage until people are begging you to get off. 
I like the idea of leaving them wanting a bit more.
    -- Quentin Tarantino
