        <h1>His Life and First Steps in Film</h1>
        <p>Tarantino was born in 1963 to 16-year-old Connie McHugh and 21-year-old Italian-American Tony Tarantino in Knoxville, Tennessee.
            <br> 
            He owes his name to Quint Asper, a character in the western series Gunsmoke played by Burt Reynolds.
            <br> 
            The character on the series was half Native American like Tarantino's mother (half Irish and half Cherokee ancestry).
            <br>
            When Tarantino was two years old, his mother moved with him to Los Angeles, where she raised him alone.
            <br>
            As an only child, he particularly liked to spend his free time in small suburban cinemas, which mainly showed martial arts and B movies ( grindhouse films ).
            <br>
            Tarantino dropped out of high school at age 15 and began acting training. Tarantino is dyslexic. 
            <br>
            Five years later, his extensive knowledge of film detail got him a job at the Video Archives video store in Manhattan Beach.
            <br> 
            He co-wrote the screenplays My Best Friend's Birthday (1987, the last two acts of the film burned in the editing room after completion)
            <br> 
            and The Open Road with friends Roger Avary and Jerry Martinez . However, the latter was rejected by all studios because of its length (over 500 pages)
            <br> 
            and later in True Romanceand Natural Born Killers. Tarantino's film career then began with a deliberate lie: he claimed that he had played a role in
            <br> 
            Godard's film adaptation of King Lear "that no one would ever look at anyway" (quote Tarantino).
            <br>
            At Sundance, Tarantino attended Robert Redford 's directing workshop, where he met Terry Gilliam.
            <br>
            This encouraged him regarding the implementation of cinematic ideas; because there are enough specialists. 
            <br>
            As a director, Tarantino said in an interview with the weekly, you just have to know what you want - "that's how I became a director".
