        <h1>His Life and First Steps in Film</h1>
        <p>Tarantino was born in 1963 to 16-year-old Connie McHugh and 21-year-old Italian-American Tony Tarantino in Knoxville, Tennessee. 
            He owes his name to Quint Asper, a character in the western series Gunsmoke played by Burt Reynolds. 
            The character on the series was half Native American like Tarantino's mother (half Irish and half Cherokee ancestry).
            When Tarantino was two years old, his mother moved with him to Los Angeles, where she raised him alone. 
            As an only child, he particularly liked to spend his free time in small suburban cinemas, which mainly showed martial arts and B movies ( grindhouse films ).
            Tarantino dropped out of high school at age 15 and began acting training. [1] Tarantino is dyslexic. 
            Five years later, his extensive knowledge of film detail got him a job at the Video Archives video store in Manhattan Beach. 
            He co-wrote the screenplays My Best Friend's Birthday (1987, the last two acts of the film burned in the editing room after completion) 
            and The Open Road with friends Roger Avary and Jerry Martinez . However, the latter was rejected by all studios because of its length (over 500 pages) 
            and later in True Romanceand Natural Born Killers. Tarantino's film career then began with a deliberate lie: he claimed that he had played a role in 
            Godard's film adaptation of King Lear "that no one would ever look at anyway" (quote Tarantino).
            At Sundance, Tarantino attended Robert Redford 's directing workshop, where he met Terry Gilliam.
            This encouraged him regarding the implementation of cinematic ideas; because there are enough specialists. 
            As a director, Tarantino said in an interview with the weekly, you just have to know what you want - "that's how I became a director".
